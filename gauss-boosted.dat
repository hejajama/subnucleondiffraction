# Parameters for J/Psi and \gamma^* wave function overlap
# 
# Model: Boosted gaussian 
# Parameters are taken from an article by Kowalski, Motyka 
# and Watt, see arXiv: hep-ph/0606272v2
#
# Syntax of this file is the following:
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Parameters are given as a pair key:value
# Values are in units of GeV^n and possible keys are:
# e_f, m_f, M_V, N_T, N_L, R, S alpha and del
#
#
#e_f: Effective charge: 2/3
e_f:0.66666666
#N_T, N_L, R_T, R_L: Normalization for transversial/lognitudial components
N_T:0.578
N_L:0.575
#sqrt(2.3)
R:1.516575
m_f:1.4
M_V:3.097
# delta: 0 or 1: one part of the wave functio is multiplied by delta
del:1
# State S=n, J/Psi is S=1
S:1
# alpha needed for higher S states, no effect for S=1
alpha:0
