This code requires my "amplitudelib" helper library
Check that you have downloaded it from git and succesfully
compiled (using CMake). The produced libraries should be
found in the directory
../amplitudelib_v2/build/lib/

How to compile:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Code requires GSL, and C++ and Fortran compilers. CMake takes care of
finding the correct compiler flags etc.

Part of this code package is 
libColorDipole (IPsat parametrization from Phys.Rev. D87 (2013) no.3, 034002)
CMake compiles that, too. 

How to run:
In the main directory:
See ./build/bin/subnucleondiffraction -help
Examples

Random seed is set by GSL_RNG_SEED enviromental variable. One MUST use the same RNG_SEED when calculating real and 
imaginary parts!

Round proton is "ipsatproton 0 4"
Q_s fluctautoins for constituent quarks are set as:
-qsfluct 0.5 -qsfluctshape quarks 

IP-Glasma input (file containing N^2 wilson lines) is used as follows:
-dipole 1 ipglasma FILENAME stepsize
step size is in GeV^-1
